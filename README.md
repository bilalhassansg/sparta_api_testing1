## Single Postcode
### I have been asked to get the information of the post code using api and json. I had to require httparty and json for this to happen and then parse the json document to get the information from the body.

## Multiple Postcode
###Â I have been asked to get information from multiple postcodes similar to the single postcodes. To do this, I have put the postcodes in an array. Once the file had been run, the information had been displayed in linear form displaying the postcode in the order it has been put in from the array.
